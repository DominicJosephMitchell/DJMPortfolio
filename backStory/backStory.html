                You surely have one or two things you'd love to do with your life.
                Let's get 'em on paper! You could integrate with a third-party location-based API to allow
                users to search for a location or venue to add to their bucket list items.
                A number of experiences or achievements that a person hopes to have or accomplish during their
                lifetime.

                This was a Team project.
                Team Name: Sleepy Squirrel Squad (#SSS)
                <br>
                Members: Josh, Danielle, Tyler and Dominic
                <br>
                <br>
                This is a funny name for the Team. We actually named it sleepy squad but our instructor wrote
                down
                squirrel squad; we changed it to #SSS. I was named Scrum Master and decided to divide the
                project
                into to four sections, aimed at the strengths of each team member. Each team member was the lead
                on thier
                section, as all four of us worked together as a group. The next disscussion was to have fun!
                Work the
                project, meet the requirements, but have FUN ! And we did ...
                <br>
                <br>
                We met and passed all the requirements of the project, and showed our fun and silly side as a
                team at
                our presentation. I wanted to step it up a notch as a team, and had shirts made for us to wear
                with
                name tags representing different elements, our team and the holidays (since it was Christmas).
